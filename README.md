### Color palette

> **Note**: A color palette, in the digital world, refers to the **full range of colors** that can be displayed on a device screen or other interface. The color palette **reveals a lot** about the electronic design of the device or technology, and its visual capabilities for human users.

## Standards

Standard and styleguides should be learned, understood, and implemented at **all times** on a project, and any deviation must be fully justified.

## Accessibility

> **Note**: "_Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y — as in, "a", then 11 characters, and then "y") in web development means enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way._" - [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)

> **Note**: "_The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability._" - [W3C - Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility)

### Customer journey map

> **Note**: A customer journey map is a **diagram** (or several diagrams) that depict the stages customers go through when **interacting** with a company product or platform.

<br />

_Here you can see an example of a customer journey for an E-Commerce platform: the largest number of interactions are in the "Acquisition" stage. It also considers future user engagement touchpoints such as a newsletter._

**Pros**:

1. Gives us insight into users’ needs and which features to prioritize
2. Can be used as a **communication tool** across all the business teams
3. Decreases customer churn and increases customer lifetime value

**Cons**:

1. Needs to have very clear intent and a well defined scope level
2. Needs **cross-teams effort** and support to be implemented
3. Needs - "_quite a lot of_" - customers data to rely on

<br/>

### Documentation

> **Note**: Documenting is a fundamental act to make sure that project requirements are **fulfilled** and to establish traceability concerning **what** has been done, **who** has done it, and **when** it has been done.

> 😉 **<ins>Hint</ins>**: To keep a history of the changes made on a project you should create a [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ChrisUser/design-systems-diary/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) file and keep it in the root folder of the project itself.

**Pros**:

1. Gives all the designers and frontend devs a full comprehensive guide to use and understand the best scenarios for each component
2. Works as a **dynamic database** of assets, illustrations, components and compositions

**Cons**:

1. Needs to be maintained constantly over time for each small change made by everyone in the dev or design team
2. Can become too specific or complicated if there's **lack of communication** between the parts
