### Color palette

> **Note**: A color palette, in the digital world, refers to the **full range of colors** that can be displayed on a device screen or other interface. The color palette **reveals a lot** about the electronic design of the device or technology, and its visual capabilities for human users.

## Accessibility

> **Note**: "_Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y ‚Äî as in, "a", then 11 characters, and then "y") in web development means enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way._" - [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)

> **Note**: "_The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability._" - [W3C - Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility)

## Maintenance

### Customer journey map

> **Note**: A customer journey map is a **diagram** (or several diagrams) that depict the stages customers go through when **interacting** with a company product or platform.

<br />

_Here you can see an example of a customer journey for an E-Commerce platform: the largest number of interactions are in the "Acquisition" stage. It also considers future user engagement touchpoints such as a newsletter._

**Pros**:

1. Gives us insight into users‚Äô needs and which features to prioritize
2. Can be used as a **communication tool** across all the business teams
3. Decreases customer churn and increases customer lifetime value

**Cons**:

1. Needs to have very clear intent and a well defined scope level
2. Needs **cross-teams effort** and support to be implemented
3. Needs - "_quite a lot of_" - customers data to rely on

### Documenting a design system

> **Note**: Documenting is a fundamental act to make sure that project requirements are **fulfilled** and to establish traceability concerning **what** has been done, **who** has done it, and **when** it has been done.

> **<ins>Hint</ins>**: To keep a history of the changes made on a project you should create a [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ChrisUser/design-systems-diary/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) file and keep it in the root folder of the project itself.
