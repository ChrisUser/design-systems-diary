**Pros**:

1. Gives us insight into users’ needs and which features to prioritize
2. Can be used as a **communication tool** across all the business teams
3. Decreases customer churn and increases customer lifetime value

**Cons**:

1. Needs to have very clear intent and a well defined scope level
2. Needs **cross-teams effort** and support to be implemented
3. Needs - "_quite a lot of_" - customers data to rely on
