### Pros

1. Gives us insight into users’ needs and which features to prioritize;
2. Can be used as a **communication tool** across all the business teams;
3. Decreases customer churn and increases customer lifetime value;

### Cons

1. Needs to have very clear intent and a well defined scope level;
2. Needs cross-teams effort and support to be implemented;
3. Needs - "_quite a lot of_" - customers data to rely on;
