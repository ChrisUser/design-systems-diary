## Topic

### Accessibility

> **Note**: "_Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y — as in, "a", then 11 characters, and then "y") in web development means enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way._" - [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)

> **Note**: "_The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability._" - [W3C - Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility)

_Here you can see an example of a customer journey for an E-Commerce platform: the largest number of interactions are in the "Acquisition" stage. It also considers future user engagement touchpoints such as a newsletter._

**Pros**:

1. Gives us insight into users’ needs and which features to prioritize
2. Can be used as a **communication tool** across all the business teams
3. Decreases customer churn and increases customer lifetime value

**Cons**:

1. Needs to have very clear intent and a well defined scope level
2. Needs **cross-teams effort** and support to be implemented
3. Needs - "_quite a lot of_" - customers data to rely on
